## Code Example

There is everything on the code, a nice trick is to change the secret, or to ask for it(since it is hardcoded by now). Also, the alphabet is a nice feature, since you can decide to use lowercase or uppercase accordingly, but pay attention to change the division factor according to the alphabet size.
